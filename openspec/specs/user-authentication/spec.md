# User Authentication System Specification

## Purpose
Provide secure JWT-based authentication for administrators with role-based access control, session management, and comprehensive security features to protect sensitive administrative functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Admin Authentication
Authorized administrators SHALL securely access the admin dashboard through a JWT-based authentication system.

#### Scenario: Admin Login
- **WHEN** an administrator enters valid credentials on the login page
- **THEN** the system SHALL issue a JWT token and redirect to the admin dashboard

#### Scenario: Session Management
- **WHEN** an administrator is logged in
- **THEN** the system SHALL maintain session state with automatic token refresh and logout on expiration

#### Scenario: Unauthorized Access Protection
- **WHEN** an unauthorized user attempts to access admin pages
- **THEN** the system SHALL redirect to the login page with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement: Role-Based Access Control
The system SHALL enforce role-based permissions for different administrative functions.

#### Scenario: Role Assignment
- **WHEN** user accounts are created in the system
- **THEN** each account SHALL be assigned specific roles (admin, content_manager, product_manager) with appropriate permissions

#### Scenario: Permission Enforcement
- **WHEN** users attempt to access protected features
- **THEN** the system SHALL verify permissions based on assigned roles before granting access

#### Scenario: Audit Trail
- **WHEN** administrative actions are performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL log user actions, timestamps, and IP addresses for security auditing

### Requirement: Security Compliance
Authentication mechanisms SHALL comply with modern security standards and best practices.

#### Scenario: Password Security
- **WHEN** administrator passwords are created or updated
- **THEN** passwords SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with salt and meet complexity requirements

#### Scenario: Token Security
- **WHEN** JWT tokens are issued
- **THEN** tokens SHALL include expiration claims, be cryptographically signed, and be stored securely

#### Scenario: Rate Limiting
- **WHEN** login attempts are made
- **THEN** the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Requirement: Performance
Authentication processes SHALL complete quickly without impacting user experience.

#### Scenario: Login Response Time
- **WHEN** administrators submit login credentials
- **THEN** authentication response SHALL occur within 1 second under normal load

#### Scenario: Token Validation
- **WHEN** API requests are made with valid tokens
- **THEN** token validation SHALL add minimal overhead (<50ms) to request processing

### Requirement: Reliability
Authentication services SHALL maintain high availability and error resilience.

#### Scenario: Service Continuity
- **WHEN** Cloudflare Workers experience temporary issues
- **THEN** authentication state SHALL be preserved through client-side token storage

#### Scenario: Error Recovery
- **WHEN** authentication failures occur
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

## Design Considerations

### Authentication Flow
1. Client submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials against D1 database
3. Server issues JWT with user claims and expiration
4. Client stores token securely (httpOnly cookie or localStorage)
5. Subsequent requests include Bearer token
6. Server validates token on each protected route

### Security Implementation
- Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens with RS256 signing and 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration stored securely
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Content Security Policy headers implementation

### Database Schema
- Users table: id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at
- Sessions table: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, ip_address
- Audit log table: id, user_id, action, resource, timestamp, ip_address

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses for authentication failures
- Account lockout after failed attempts (5 attempts, 15-minute lockout)
- Secure error logging without exposing sensitive information
