## Design Considerations

### Content Architecture
- Content stored in D1 with JSON fields for multilingual data
- Content types: pages, sections, components, media assets
- Hierarchical content structure with parent-child relationships
- Content status workflow (draft, review, published, archived)

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for content CRUD operations
- GraphQL-like filtering for content queries
- Bulk operations for content updates and translations
- Webhook support for content change notifications

### Caching Strategy
- Edge caching through Cloudflare CDN
- Content-based cache invalidation
- Separate cache policies for different content types
- Cache warming for frequently accessed content

### Content Modeling
```
Content Structure:
├── Pages (homepage, about, contact, etc.)
├── Sections (hero, features, testimonials, etc.)
├── Components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
├── Media Assets (images, documents, videos)
└── SEO Metadata (titles, descriptions, structured data)
```

### Workflow Integration
- Content approval workflow for different user roles
- Scheduled content publishing
- Content expiry and archival
- Multi-step content creation process

### Internationalization
- Language fallback mechanisms (en → zh → ru)
- RTL language support preparation
- Localized date/time and number formatting
- Currency and region-specific content variations
