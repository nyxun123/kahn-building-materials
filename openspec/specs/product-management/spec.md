## Design Considerations

### Data Structure
- Products stored in Cloudflare D1 with structured technical parameters
- Image metadata and R2 URLs stored alongside product data
- Multilingual content using JSON fields for localized data

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for product CRUD operations
- GraphQL-like filtering for complex product searches
- CDN caching headers for product images and static content

### Security
- Admin authentication required for product management
- Input validation and sanitization for all product data
- Rate limiting on product search endpoints to prevent abuse
