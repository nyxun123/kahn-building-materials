## Design Considerations

### Data Structure
- Inquiries table: id, name, email, phone, company, message, type, language, status, created_at, updated_at
- Responses table: id, inquiry_id, admin_id, response_text, sent_at, email_status
- Assignments table: id, inquiry_id, assigned_to, assigned_at, completed_at

### Form Types
1. **General Inquiry**: Basic contact form for general questions
2. **OEM Inquiry**: Detailed form for customization requests
3. **Technical Support**: Form for product technical questions
4. **Partnership**: Form for business partnership proposals

### Email Templates
- Customer confirmation emails in multiple languages
- Internal notification emails for administrators
- Response templates for common inquiry types
- Follow-up reminder emails for unresolved inquiries

### Security Measures
- reCAPTCHA v3 integration for bot detection
- Rate limiting: 5 submissions per IP per hour
- Input sanitization using DOMPurify or similar
- CSRF protection on all form submissions
- Email validation with MX record verification when possible

### Workflow Integration
```
Inquiry Lifecycle:
1. Submission → Validation → Storage → Notification
2. Assignment → Response → Follow-up → Resolution
3. Analytics → Reporting → Process Improvement
```

### Analytics and Reporting
- Inquiry volume trends by type and language
- Response time metrics and SLA tracking
- Conversion rate from inquiry to customer
- Geographic distribution of inquiries
- Common inquiry topics and automation opportunities
