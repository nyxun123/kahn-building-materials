# Emergency Product Display Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This is a P1 emergency fix for critical issues affecting the wallpaper adhesive company website's product functionality. Two critical problems have been identified: 1) Frontend product detail pages are accessible but not displaying product information properly, and 2) Backend management platform shows no products in the product management interface. This fix is essential for maintaining business operations and customer experience.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This emergency fix directly supports the company's goal of providing a professional, functional website for customers to browse and inquire about wallpaper adhesive products. The backend management system is crucial for maintaining up-to-date product information, which is essential for sales operations and customer service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Restore Frontend Product Detail Display

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see complete product information when I click "Learn More" on a product, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Learn More" on any product THEN the system SHALL display the product detail page with complete information
2. WHEN the product detail page loads THEN the system SHALL show product name, description, features, specifications, applications, and packaging options
3. WHEN viewing product details THEN the system SHALL display the correct product images
4. IF a product has no data in a specific field THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide that section
5. WHEN product information is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper styling and layout

### Requirement 2 - Restore Backend Product Management Data

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want to see all products in the backend management system, so that I can manage product information and maintain the website content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator logs into the backend THEN the system SHALL display all active products in the product management section
2. WHEN viewing the product list THEN the system SHALL show product codes, names, categories, and status
3. WHEN products are displayed THEN the system SHALL allow pagination and filtering
4. IF the database contains products THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display them correctly
5. WHEN accessing product management THEN the system SHALL maintain proper authentication and authorization

### Requirement 3 - Verify API Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure all product APIs are functioning correctly, so that both frontend and backend systems receive accurate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the public products API THEN the system SHALL return all active products with complete information
2. WHEN calling the admin products API with proper authentication THEN the system SHALL return the complete product list
3. WHEN querying individual product details THEN the system SHALL return accurate and complete data
4. IF API responses are successful THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP status codes
5. WHEN data is returned THEN the system SHALL ensure JSON structure is valid and complete

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Fix the specific display and data retrieval issues without affecting other functionality
- **Modular Design**: Ensure API endpoints, database queries, and frontend components work together properly
- **Dependency Management**: Verify that Refine framework, authentication, and data fetching are properly configured
- **Clear Interfaces**: Maintain clean data flow between database, API, frontend, and admin interface

### Performance
- API response times should be under 2 seconds for product listings
- Frontend page load times should be under 3 seconds
- Database queries should be optimized for quick product retrieval

### Security
- Maintain proper authentication for admin endpoints
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in public APIs
- Verify CORS and CSP configurations are correct

### Reliability
- Fix must be stable and not cause regressions
- Error handling should be robust and informative
- System should gracefully handle missing or incomplete data

### Usability
- Product information should be clearly presented and easy to read
- Admin interface should be intuitive for product management
- Error messages should be helpful and guide users to solutions
